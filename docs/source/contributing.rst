Contributing
============

Development happens on `github <https://github.com/luispedro/mahotas>`__ and
the preferred contribution method is by forking the repository and issuing a
pull request. Alternatively, just sending a patch to luis@luispedro.org will
work just as well.

If you don't know git (or another distributed version control system), which is
a fantastic tool in general, there are several good git and github tutorials.
You can start with their `official documentation <https://help.github.com/>`__.

If you want to work on the C++ code, you can read the chapter in the `internals
<internals.html>`__ before you start. Also, read the `principles
<principles.html>`__ declaration.


Debug Mode
----------

If you compile mahotas in debug mode, then it will run slower but perform a lot
of runtime checks. This is controlled by the ``DEBUG`` environment variable.

There are two levels:

1.  ``DEBUG=1`` This turns on assertions. The code will run slower, but
    probably not noticeably slower, except for very large images.
2.  ``DEBUG=2`` This turns on the assertions and additionally uses the debug
    version of the C++ library (this is probably only working if you are using
    GCC). Some of the internal code also picks up on this and adds even more
    sanity checking. The result will be code that runs **much slower** as all
    operations done through iterators into standard containers are now checked
    (including many inner loop operations).

The Makefile that comes with the source helps you::

    make clean
    make debug
    make test

will rebuild in debug mode and run all tests. When you are done testing, use
the ``fast`` Make target to get the non-debug build::

    make clean
    make fast

Using make will not change your environment. The ``DEBUG`` variable is set
internally only.

If you don't know about it, check out `ccache <http://ccache.samba.org/>`__
which is a great tool if you are developing in compiled languages (this is not
specific to mahotas or even Python). It will allow you to quickly perform
``make clean; make debug`` and ``make clean; make fast`` so you never get your
builds mixed up.
